					<h2 style="color:#fff;background:#07cbc9">About Al-Bashir International School </h2>
					<p>Our mission is to provide cost-effective world class education in a safe, peaceful, disciplined and intellectually stimulating environment. Our team of dedicated and well-trained teachers purpose to raise fine, well-rounded, well-educated, well-cultured, respectable, God-fearing ladies who will make huge contributions towards the promotion and protection of human dignity in our society. We aim to achieve this through the effective deployment of state-of-the-art technology and modern pedagogical approaches in addition to rich moral instruction – which reflect our Islamic ethos.</p>
					Our Philosophy
					<p>We are ardent proponents of social change.  We believe that the highest level of human achievement is service - service to Allah.  In our own little way, we have conceived the creation of Al-Bashir International School as our contribution towards the betterment of educational opportunities available to young people in our society. 

					We hope that through the cost-effective provision of world-class education at Al-Bashir International School, it can be demonstrated that a lot more is possible than we think. We believe that our youngsters deserve better and that there is enough success for all. With a bit of human will, we can all work together to stamp out the scarcity mentality so prevalent in our society and replace it with the abundance mentality where everybody is a winner.</p>
					<h2 style="color:#fff;background:#07cbc9">Why Al-Bashir School</h2>
					<p><b style="color:#07cbc9">Personalised Learning </b>– Following the “Every Child Matters” agenda, Al-Bashir Int'L School seeks to ensure that every child is safe, healthy, enjoys and achieves through learning, makes a positive contribution to society and achieves economic well-being.  An individual education plan (I.E.P.) is drawn up for every child ensuring that she makes progress in every subject.  At Madonna, we benchmark pupils as individuals, carry out a detailed diagnosis of their areas of weakness before embarking on a vigorous trouble-shooting exercise which will culminate in every child making progress over and above what is expected.</p>
					<p><b style="color:#07cbc9">In the Right Hands</b> – It is unusual to have a school of this scale with professional teachers in the driving seat.  Traditionally, teachers do not have the wherewithal to embark on such projects leaving the industry to business men and women whose passions are not necessarily in the art of teaching and learning.  At Madonna, we have really committed, enthusiastic, visionary and passionate teachers whose first and only interest is in teaching and learning and making a real difference in the lives of many children.  The proprietors are professional educationists of international repute having worked for many years in Nigeria and abroad. </p>

					<p><b style="color:#07cbc9">Superb Facilities </b>– As a school offering world class education, we are in the process of building a campus with every desirable facility to make a child’s six years residence a truly memorable experience. First class boarding facilities, library, laboratories, I.C.T. suites, health centre and sick bay, dining hall, sports fields, swimming pool, etc. </p>
					<p><b style="color:#07cbc9">Cost-effectiveness </b>– By employing cost-saving financial strategies of world-class organizations, the location of Al-Bashir International School in the sub-urban countryside has meant a reduction in costs when compared with bigger cities. Also, fresh food and fruits from farms at reduced costs mean that we can pass these savings straight on to you – the customer, giving you excellent value for your money. As an organization that believes in Total Quality Management, Al-Bashir adopts very stringent measure in ensuring that processes within the school - whether it be in teaching and learning, pupil behaviour or administrative work - are all very efficient, well thought out and grounded in our overarching philosophy of excellence.</p>

					<p><b style="color:#07cbc9">Reasonable Fees </b> - Our fees are very reasonable.  The facilities that we have provided suggest a high fee paying school but the contrary is the case.  This is on purpose.  Our mission is to offer affordable, cost-effective world class education to the average Nigerian family and as such, are fees are moderate and comparably lower to similar schools.  Here at Madonna, we give excellent value for money! </p>

					<p><b style="color:#07cbc9">We Value People</b> – Al-Bashir Int'L Sch is a people-oriented institution.  We value people.  Your contributions will be highly valued.  We are change agents with a social change agenda in support of the common man and we believe that with your support, we can do really great things.  We have started and we invite you to join our campaign by choosing Al-Bashir International School. </p>
